Each `dayXX` folder contains:
- `README.md` → notes and explanation for that day  
- `commands.sh` → executable commands/scripts used for the task (Some Days won't have .sh Files)

## How to Use This Repository
1. Browse the `dayXX` folders to see the tasks and solutions.  
2. Execute the `commands.sh` scripts in a safe lab environment to practice.  
3. Use this as a reference guide or cheat sheet for DevOps/Linux administration.  

## Notes
- All tasks are performed in Linux environments (Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL).  
- Root access is carefully restricted to simulate secure production practices.  
- This repo is continuously updated as the 100-day challenge progresses.
