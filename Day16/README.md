[sudo] password for loki: 

Now install Nginx using yum:
yum install nginx -y

üì¶ Output Summary:
- Dependencies like `nginx-core`, `nginx-filesystem`, and `centos-logos-httpd` were installed.
- Weak dependency `logrotate` was also installed.
- All packages installed successfully without errors.
- The installation completed with the message ‚ÄúComplete!‚Äù

Verify Nginx installation:
nginx -v

Start and enable the Nginx service:
systemctl restart nginx
systemctl status nginx

‚úÖ Output:
‚óè nginx.service - The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; disabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sun 2025-10-12 16:20:20 UTC
   Main PID: 2241 (nginx)
   Tasks: 17
   Memory: 16.1M
   CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service
   Processes: multiple worker processes running normally

Note:
- Nginx started successfully with no syntax or port conflict errors.
- The only non-critical message seen: "Failed to send unit change signal for nginx.service: Connection reset by peer" ‚Äî this can be safely ignored; it‚Äôs related to containerized or virtual environments.

Check Nginx configuration syntax for correctness:
nginx -t
‚úÖ Output:
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful

Restart Nginx again after config validation:
systemctl restart nginx
systemctl status nginx

‚úÖ Final Output:
‚óè nginx.service - The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; disabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sun 2025-10-12 16:24:57 UTC
   Main PID: 2574 (nginx)
   Tasks: 17
   Memory: 16.1M
   CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service
   All worker processes running correctly.
